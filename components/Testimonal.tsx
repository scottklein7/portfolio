                    I hired Scott to work on a project 2 years ago. He was polite, efficient and his work was first rate. Since then, I’ve hired him for follow on work. Scott is very bright, a self starter and finds creative solutions to challenges.
                    He is also incredibly responsible. Once he sent a family member to complete a task when he was unable to to come in person because he was in the emergency room. Any company would be lucky to have Scott as an employee.
