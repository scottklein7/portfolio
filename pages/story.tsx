                        <p>I often times forget how blessed I truly am. Although it was a strange and windy path getting here,I reflect on how God has guided me through the dark in each and every moment in my life.</p>
                        <p>
                            I would have never imagined to be in the position I am today...
                            When I was younger I used to dread the thought of the traditional
                            9-5 cubicle job, thinking that somehow I was predestined for it, just as all my peers were. And that I had to go to college to "be successful" (whatever that means). I soon realized I could do whatever I wanted, it just required attention and effort. I dropped out of college and tried something different.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This ideology has followed me ever since. Before web development I worked restaurant jobs, started a successful landscaping company with hundred of completed projects and many happy clients, managing an estate (something I still do). But, I always wanted to do something technical, as software has always interested me.
                            So I decided software was something I wanted to do, and enrolled in a speciality school called general assembly. It was basically like going to become a plumber but for software engineering. I was taught how to learn, rather than being told how to learn (a common problem in schooling). And ever since then its been nothing but coding!

                            Web Design is a constantly changing field, software updates, new tools come out, etc. Being on top of it takes a curious mind, lucky for you my mind is always hungry for more information. I have never been able to quench my curiosity, I am constantly exploring topics weather it be my faith, software, macro economics, health, or farming.
                            I listned to enough podcasts this past year to make my head explode. If you didnt realize already, Im not a fan of the tradtional EDU system. I love learning for fun, not for grades, or piece of paper.
                        </p>
                        <p>Anyways, go outside, be joyful, praise God, and hire me for your web development needs! ðŸ˜‰</p>
