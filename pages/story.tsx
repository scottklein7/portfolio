                        <p>I often times forget how blessed I truly am. Although it was a strange and windy path getting here, I reflect on how God has led me at every moment of my life.</p>
                        <p>
                            I would have never imagined to be in the position I am today... When I was younger I used to dread the thought of the traditional 9-5 cubicle job, thinking that somehow I was predestined for it, just as all my peers were.  I was told I had to go to college to "be successful" (whatever that means). Yet, college seemed like it would only force me further into that dreaded lifestyle. I soon realized I could do whatever I wanted, it just required attention and effort. So, I left college and took a more appealing path.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This ideology has followed me ever since. Before web development I worked restaurant jobs, I started a successful landscaping company  - with hundreds of completed projects and many happy clients, to managing an estate (something I still do). However, I always wanted to do something technical, as software has always interested me. So, I took a chance, and enrolled in a specialized tech school called General Assembly. I was taught how to learn new skills on the fly, effectively becoming an adaptive learner. When it was all said and done, I left with actual skills not just a glorified piece of paper.

                        A major component of being a good software engineer is the desire to learn, it takes a curious mind to navigate the ever changing field. Practices are constantly changing, software updates come out, new tech stacks evolve, protocols change, etc. Which is why I believe I was meant to be a software engineer, I have never been able to quench my curiosity, I am constantly exploring topics whether it be my faith, software, macro economics, health, or farming. Trust me, if something is changing I am gonna be on top if it, otherwise I wouldn't be able to provide you with the best services.
                        </p>
                        <p>Anyways, go outside, be joyful, praise God, and hire me for your web development needs! ðŸ˜‰</p>
